Python-based random Haiku generator

In an attempt to learn python, I'm writing some random entertaining 
programs.  This is one of them.  Given that I'm still learning, don't 
expect this to be coded anywhere close to a professional level.

Comments and suggestions welcome.  Patches too, but I'll branch them 
as it would otherwise defeat the purpose.
